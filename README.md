# Probabilistic Inference: Monty Hall Problem Using Bayesian Network
This repository contains a solution to the problem of determining the probability of a host being chosen for a game show given the contestant and prize. The solution is implemented using the pgmpy library, which is a Python library for probabilistic graphical models.

## Tech Stack
- Python, 
- pgmpy library.
## Documentation
The documentation for the pgmpy library can be found at https://pgmpy.org/docs/index.html.

## Lessons Learned
- This solution taught me how to use the pgmpy library to create and manipulate Bayesian networks. 
- I also learned how to use the TabularCPD function to define the CPDs for a Bayesian network.
